# PROMPT FOR GENERATING index.html and style.css

## copy paste this prompt in chatgpt and take the html generated and paste it in index.html and style.css

Generate a complete tech portfolio website for a Computer Science student, with two separate files:

index.html – full HTML structure

style.css – all styling (no Tailwind, no Bootstrap, pure CSS)

Requirements:

Include the following sections in the HTML:

Header + Navigation (Links: Overview, Skills, Tech Stack, Projects, Contact)

Hero/Overview Section – Name, short description (CS student), role, resume button

Skills Section – Organized list with skill bars / percentages

Tech Stack Section – Icons or badges for languages, tools, frameworks

Projects Section – Cards with title, description, tech used, GitHub / Live links

Education Section – Degree, University, Graduation year

Contact/Footer – Email, GitHub, LinkedIn, Copyright

Hobby section - Hobbies

The CSS file should:

Make the layout fully responsive (mobile-first)

Use modern design (flexbox or grid, hover effects, clean fonts, smooth transitions)

Have variables for colors and fonts at the top

Include a dark/light mode toggle (JavaScript in HTML, CSS variables in CSS)

Use semantic HTML5 tags (<header>, <main>, <section>, <footer>, <nav>, etc.)

Use placeholder content (name, skills, project links) and add comments like <!-- Change Name Here -->

Do NOT use external frameworks or CDN libraries

Final output should be two separate files:

First: full index.html

Second: full style.css

Output only the code for both files, nothing else.
